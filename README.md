# Noice

Noice is a simplified RTS (Real Time Strategy) game with an online focus made
with Godot.

## About the game

The purpose of Noice is to capture all bases, attacking them with the army of
ships youdevelop. Each base is connected to some other bases, so you can attack
only a limited number of bases.
If you want to understand better that concept, you can see the game that
influenciated ours, [ICE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.queader.ice).

## Development

It is still under development and no usable product is available at the moment.
Because of that, the information on building is not very useful aside for those
who plan on contributing (which we appreciate). If you plan on contributing,
check [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Dependencies

Since the project uses Godot, the game don't have any dependencies.

## License

All code in this repository unless where stated otherwise is released under the
GNU Affero GPL at the moment (which may change in the future). For more
